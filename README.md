# Bloch-Sphere-Visualizer
HTML web tool designed to help fellow students understand phase changes on the bloch sphere. 

### note to self
- It’s unclear to me whether visualization genuinely aids understanding beyond pedagogical intuition.
- I’m not confident where this breaks down compared to density-matrix–based approaches.
- Visualization is currently limited to single-qubit states; I’m unsure how meaningful Bloch-sphere intuition remains once noise dominates.
